## Security Considerations

1. **Change the default password** - Never use "admin123" in production
2. **Use strong JWT secrets** - Generate random, long strings
3. **HTTPS only** - Always use HTTPS in production
4. **Regular updates** - Update dependencies regularly
5. **Access logs** - Monitor admin access in production
6. **Database security** - Secure MongoDB connection

## Upcoming Features

## Development

```bash
# Run locally
npm run dev

# Access admin panel
http://localhost:3000/admin

# Seed leagues (if needed)
npm run seed:leagues
```

Default credentials for development:
- Password: `admin123`

Remember to change this in production!

## Tips

- Always select a league context before managing matches
- Players must be "confirmed" or "active" to be paired
- ELO changes are permanent once a result is entered
- Use the league filter to manage multiple leagues efficiently
- Export player data regularly for backups
