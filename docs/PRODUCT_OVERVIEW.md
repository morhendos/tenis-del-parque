## Key Questions

### What problem does it solve?

Amateur tennis players struggle to find regular, competitive matches against opponents of similar skill level. There's no organized structure outside of expensive club memberships - just informal WhatsApp groups and hoping to find someone available.

### For whom is it?

Recreational and amateur tennis players in Costa del Sol (Sotogrande, Marbella, Estepona, Málaga) who want consistent, organized play - from beginners to advanced club players who aren't competing professionally.

### What differentiates it from others?

ELO ranking system and Swiss pairing algorithm - typically reserved for chess and pro sports - applied to amateur tennis. This means fair matchups every round (no repeated blowouts), measurable skill progression, and cross-league rankings (OpenRank) that let players compare themselves across cities and seasons. Plus it's a lightweight PWA, not another app store download.
