# Club Editor Refactor

## Overview
Complete refactoring of the club editing experience in the admin panel, moving from a modal-based approach to a full-page editor with improved UI/UX.

## Previous Issues
- **Clunky Modal System**: 6-step modal was difficult to navigate
- **Complex Courts Management**: Overly complicated tabs and surface management
- **Poor UX**: Too many fields at once, overwhelming interface
- **Massive Component**: ClubFormModal was 1000+ lines of code
- **Broken Multi-sport Courts**: Tennis, padel, and pickleball court inputs weren't working properly

## New Features

### 1. Full-Page Editor
- **Dedicated Routes**: `/admin/clubs/new` and `/admin/clubs/[id]/edit`
- **Better Navigation**: No more modal limitations
- **Proper Back Navigation**: Clear path back to clubs list

### 2. Sidebar Navigation
- **Section-based Navigation**: Easy jumping between sections
- **Visual Progress Indicators**: Green checkmarks show completed sections
- **Quick Stats Panel**: Shows key info at a glance
- **Persistent Visibility**: Always know where you are

### 3. Simplified Courts Management
- **Simple Number Inputs**: Just enter indoor/outdoor counts
- **Automatic Totals**: No manual calculation needed
- **Visual Sport Cards**: Each sport has its own card with clear indicators
- **Working Multi-sport Support**: Tennis üéæ, Padel üè∏, and Pickleball üèì

### 4. Improved Section Design

#### Basic Info Section
- Clean form layout
- Auto-slug generation
- Tag selection with visual feedback
- Character counters for descriptions

#### Location Section
- Clear city/area selection
- Visual location preview
- Map placeholder for future integration
- Better address input fields

#### Courts Section
- **Big visual summary**: Total courts displayed prominently
- **Sport-specific cards**: Color-coded and icon-identified
- **Simple inputs**: Just indoor/outdoor numbers
- **Auto-calculation**: Totals update automatically

#### Amenities Section
- **Grouped by category**: Essential vs Premium
- **Visual checkboxes**: Custom styled with icons
- **Clear selection state**: Purple highlights for selected items
- **Summary counter**: Shows total selected amenities/services

#### Contact & Hours Section
- **Organized subsections**: Contact, Hours, Pricing
- **Quick presets**: "Set all to 8-22" and "Weekday/Weekend" buttons
- **Closed day toggle**: Easy to mark days as closed
- **Clean time inputs**: Proper time picker fields

#### Images Section
- Integrated ClubImageManager
- Clear status indicators
- Upload guidelines

### 5. Better UX Elements
- **Unsaved Changes Indicator**: Orange dot shows pending changes
- **Error Messages**: Clear error display at top of content
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes
- **Consistent Styling**: Purple theme throughout

## Technical Improvements

### Component Structure
```
components/admin/clubs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ClubEditor.js (Main orchestrator, ~300 lines)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ editor/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BasicInfoSection.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LocationSection.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CourtsSection.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AmenitiesSection.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ContactSection.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ImagesSection.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ClubFormModal.js (Deprecated)
```

### Key Changes
1. **Modular Architecture**: Each section is its own component
2. **Simplified State Management**: Cleaner formData structure
3. **Proper Routing**: Uses Next.js routing instead of modals
4. **Better Data Flow**: Clear props passing and change handlers
5. **Simplified Courts Structure**: Removed complex surfaces management

## Migration Notes

### Courts Data Structure
Simplified from:
```javascript
courts: {
  tennis: {
    total: 10,
    indoor: 2,
    outdoor: 8,
    surfaces: [{ type: 'clay', count: 6 }, { type: 'hard', count: 4 }]
  }
}
```

To:
```javascript
courts: {
  tennis: { total: 10, indoor: 2, outdoor: 8 },
  padel: { total: 4, indoor: 0, outdoor: 4 },
  pickleball: { total: 2, indoor: 0, outdoor: 2 }
}
```

### Backward Compatibility
- Legacy courts data is automatically converted
- Old modal approach still works but is deprecated
- All existing clubs will work with the new editor

## Usage

1. Navigate to `/admin/clubs`
2. Click "Add New Club" button
3. Fill in sections using sidebar navigation
4. Save when ready

### Editing an Existing Club
1. Navigate to `/admin/clubs`
2. Click "Edit" on any club row
