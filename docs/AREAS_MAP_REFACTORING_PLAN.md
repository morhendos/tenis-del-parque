# Areas Map Editor - Refactoring Plan

## 📋 Overview
Refactoring the massive `AreasMapView.js` component (35KB, 1000+ lines) into smaller, maintainable, testable pieces.

## 🎯 Goals
- **Reduce file size** - No component over 200 lines
- **Separate concerns** - UI, logic, and data management in different layers
- **Improve testability** - Isolated, pure functions and hooks
- **Better performance** - Optimized re-renders and memoization
- **Easier maintenance** - Clear file structure and responsibilities

## 📁 Target Structure

## 🔄 Rollback Plan
If refactoring causes issues:
1. All changes are in feature branch
2. Each phase is a separate commit
3. Can revert to any checkpoint
4. Original `AreasMapView.js` preserved until Phase 4

## 📝 Lessons Learned
- Phase 1: Extracting utilities was straightforward and immediately reduced file size
- Constants centralization makes configuration much easier to manage
- Phase 2: UI component extraction significantly improved code organization
- Phase 3: Custom hooks provide excellent separation of business logic
- Hooks composition pattern makes code very maintainable
- Phase 4: Extracting the map component completed the separation
- Phase 5: Performance optimization adds slight file size but improves runtime significantly
- React.memo prevents unnecessary re-renders of pure components
- useCallback and useMemo are essential for complex interactive components

## 🎉 Success Criteria
- [x] Phase 1 utilities extracted and working
- [x] Phase 2 UI components extracted and integrated
- [x] Phase 3 hooks created and integrated
- [x] Phase 4 map component extracted
