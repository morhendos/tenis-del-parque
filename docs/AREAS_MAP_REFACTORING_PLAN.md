# Areas Map Editor - Refactoring Plan

## 📋 Overview
Refactoring the massive `AreasMapView.js` component (35KB, 1000+ lines) into smaller, maintainable, testable pieces.

## 🎯 Goals
- **Reduce file size** - No component over 200 lines
- **Separate concerns** - UI, logic, and data management in different layers
- **Improve testability** - Isolated, pure functions and hooks
- **Better performance** - Optimized re-renders and memoization
- **Easier maintenance** - Clear file structure and responsibilities

## 📁 Target Structure

## ✅ Refactoring Checklist

### Phase 1: Extract Utilities & Constants ✅
- [x] Create `utils/polygonHelpers.js` with polygon calculation functions
- [x] Create `constants/mapConfig.js` with configuration
- [x] Create `utils/areaCalculations.js` for area-specific logic
- [x] Update imports in main component

### Phase 2: Extract UI Components ✅
- [x] Extract `AreaNotification.js` component
- [x] Extract `AreaStats.js` component
- [x] Extract `LeagueFilterButtons.js` component
- [x] Extract `AreaEditControls.js` component
- [x] Extract `AreaLegend.js` component
- [x] Update main component to use new UI components

### Phase 3: Create Custom Hooks 📝
- [ ] Create `useMapInitialization.js` hook
- [ ] Create `useAreaManagement.js` hook
- [ ] Create `usePolygonDrawing.js` hook
- [ ] Create `useAreaPersistence.js` hook
- [ ] Create `useClubMarkers.js` hook
- [ ] Integrate hooks into main component

### Phase 4: Extract Map Component 📝
- [ ] Create `AreaMapCanvas.js` component
- [ ] Move map rendering logic
- [ ] Implement proper prop drilling
- [ ] Add ref forwarding for map instance

### Phase 5: Optimization 📝
- [ ] Add `React.memo` to pure components
- [ ] Optimize re-renders with `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- [ ] Review and optimize effect dependencies
- [ ] Add loading states and error boundaries
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup in effects

### Phase 6: Testing 📝
- [ ] Add unit tests for utility functions
- [ ] Add tests for custom hooks
- [ ] Add component tests
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Test performance improvements

### Phase 7: Documentation 📝
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all functions
- [ ] Create component documentation
- [ ] Update main README
- [ ] Add usage examples

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Metrics
- **Original file size**: 35KB
- **Original line count**: ~1000 lines
- **Current file size**: 24KB
- **Current line count**: ~700 lines
- **Target max file size**: 10KB
- **Target max line count**: 200 lines

### Current Status
- **Phase**: 2 - Extract UI Components ✅ COMPLETED
- **Completed**: 2/7 phases
- **Estimated completion**: 1-2 hours remaining

## 🚀 Implementation Notes

### Phase 1 Notes (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Extracted all pure utility functions
- ✅ Created comprehensive configuration constants
- ✅ Added proper JSDoc documentation
- ✅ Updated main component to use utilities
- File size reduced from 35KB to 32KB
- Removed ~100 lines from main component

### Phase 2 Notes (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Extracted all UI components successfully
- ✅ Added memoization to components for performance
- ✅ Improved accessibility with aria attributes
- ✅ Enhanced UX with hover effects and animations
- File size reduced from 32KB to 24KB
- Removed ~300 lines from main component
- All components are now reusable and testable

### Naming Conventions
- Hooks: `use[Feature].js`
- Utils: `[domain]Helpers.js` or `[domain]Utils.js`
- Components: PascalCase with descriptive names
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

### Testing Strategy
- Test utils first (easiest)
- Mock Google Maps API for hook tests
- Use React Testing Library for components
- Focus on user interactions, not implementation

## 🔄 Rollback Plan
If refactoring causes issues:
1. All changes are in feature branch
2. Each phase is a separate commit
3. Can revert to any checkpoint
4. Original `AreasMapView.js` preserved until Phase 4

## 📝 Lessons Learned
- Phase 1: Extracting utilities was straightforward and immediately reduced file size
- Constants centralization makes configuration much easier to manage
- Phase 2: UI component extraction significantly improved code organization
- Memoization on components will help with performance in large datasets

## 🎉 Success Criteria
- [x] Phase 1 utilities extracted and working
- [x] Phase 2 UI components extracted and integrated
- [ ] All functionality preserved
- [ ] No component over 200 lines
- [ ] All utilities have unit tests
- [ ] Performance improved or maintained
- [ ] Code is more maintainable
- [ ] Team can easily understand structure
