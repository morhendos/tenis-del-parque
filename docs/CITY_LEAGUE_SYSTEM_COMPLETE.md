# City-Based League System - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✅

## Date: October 18, 2025

## Summary

Successfully transformed the tennis league platform from a flat league listing into a **city-based multi-league system** where users can browse leagues by city and see them organized by season status and skill level.

---

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. API Endpoint
**File**: `app/api/cities/[slug]/leagues/route.js`
- Returns all leagues for a specific city
- Groups leagues by season status (current, upcoming, past)
- Includes league counts and city information
- **Test**: `http://localhost:3000/api/cities/sotogrande/leagues`

### 2. City League Page
**File**: `app/[locale]/leagues/[city]/page.js`
- Dynamic page for each city showing all their leagues
- **URLs**: 
  - `/en/leagues/sotogrande`
  - `/en/leagues/estepona`
  - `/en/leagues/marbella`
  - `/en/leagues/malaga`
- Responsive design
- Bilingual (EN/ES)

**Components Created**:
- `CityLeagueHero.js` - City banner with breadcrumb
- `LeagueSeasonSection.js` - Groups leagues by season (current/upcoming/past)
- `LeagueLevelCard.js` - Individual league card with skill level badge

### 3. Main Leagues Directory
**File**: `app/[locale]/leagues/page.js` (updated)
- Transformed from flat league list to city directory
- Shows grid of all 4 cities with images
- Displays league count per city
- Links to city-specific pages

**Component Created**:
- `CityCard.js` - City card with image, name, league count
