### 2. Admin API Endpoints
**Locations:**
- `/app/api/admin/leagues/[id]/discounts/route.js`
- `/app/api/admin/leagues/[id]/discounts/[code]/route.js`

Secure, authenticated endpoints for:
- Creating discount codes (POST)
- Fetching discount codes (GET)
- Toggling status (PATCH)
- Deleting codes (DELETE)

### 3. League Admin Integration
**Updated:** `/app/admin/leagues/[id]/page.js`

Added two new features:

## What Works End-to-End

### Current Working Flow:

1. ‚úÖ **Admin creates discount code** in admin panel
2. ‚úÖ **System validates** code and stores in database
3. ‚úÖ **Player registers** with discount code via API
4. ‚úÖ **System validates** code is active and not expired
5. ‚úÖ **System calculates** discounted price
6. ‚úÖ **System tracks** usage (increments count, stores player info)
7. ‚úÖ **System saves** discount info in player registration
8. ‚úÖ **System sends** welcome email with discount details
9. ‚úÖ **Admin can view** usage statistics in real-time

### What's Still Pending (Phase 4):

1. ‚è≥ **Frontend registration form** doesn't have discount input yet
2. ‚è≥ **URL parameter** auto-apply not implemented in UI
3. ‚è≥ **Price display** doesn't show strikethrough yet
4. ‚è≥ **Discount savings** not prominently displayed yet

**Note:** The backend is 100% ready. Once the frontend form is updated, the entire system will work seamlessly.

## Running the Setup Script

- **SOTOGRANDE2025** - 100% off, unlimited uses  
- **EARLYBIRD** - 100% off, limited to 50 uses

The script also:

## Security

All admin endpoints are protected:
- ‚úÖ Require authentication via NextAuth
- ‚úÖ Check for admin role
- ‚úÖ Return 401 for unauthorized access
- ‚úÖ Validate all inputs
- ‚úÖ Prevent duplicate codes
- ‚úÖ Sanitize user input

## Design Decisions

### Color Theme
- **Emerald/Green** for discount-related features
- Distinguishes from other admin sections
- Conveys "savings" and "value"

### UX Choices
- One-click copy for shareable links
- Expandable usage details to reduce clutter
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Success/error notifications for all actions
- Responsive grid layout for mobile

### Data Display
- Shows top 3 active codes on league overview
- Full list on dedicated page
- Usage stats prominently displayed
- Clear active/inactive status

---

## Next Steps - Phase 4

### Frontend Registration Form Updates

**File to update:** `components/leagues/ModernRegistrationForm.js`

**Tasks:**
1. Add discount code input field to form
2. Add URL parameter checking (`?discount=CODE`)
3. Add discount validation on form
4. Show original vs. discounted price
5. Display savings prominently
6. Include discount code in submission

**Estimated time:** 2-3 hours

**Reference:** See `docs/DISCOUNT_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md` Phase 4 section for detailed implementation guide.
