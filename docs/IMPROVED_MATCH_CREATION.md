- **Blue info**: Players are from different skill levels
- Real-time validation of pairings

### 4. **Player Information Display**

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

1. **Generate Round Page** → Stores pairings in sessionStorage
2. **Match Creator** → Retrieves pairings and populates UI
3. **Drag & Drop** → Updates local state
4. **Submit** → Creates matches via API

### Key Files Modified

- `/app/admin/matches/create/page.js` - Enhanced match creation UI
- `/app/admin/matches/generate-round/page.js` - Added edit button
- `/app/admin/matches/page.js` - Improved navigation and info

### Session Storage

Swiss pairings are temporarily stored in sessionStorage:
```javascript
{
  round: 3,
  pairings: [
    {
      player1: { name, elo, wins, level },
      player2: { name, elo, wins, level },
      isRematch: false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always review warnings** - The system shows warnings but doesn't prevent matches
2. **Consider skill levels** - Especially important in early rounds
3. **Check ELO differences** - Large gaps may result in unbalanced matches
4. **Avoid rematches** - Unless necessary for tournament completion
5. **Save regularly** - Changes are only saved when you click "Create Matches"

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Undo/Redo functionality
- [ ] Save draft pairings
- [ ] Bulk operations (swap all by level)
- [ ] Match scheduling integration
- [ ] Player availability checking
- [ ] Historical pairing analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Drag and Drop Not Working
- Ensure you're in "Combined" or "Manual" mode
- Check browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari supported)

### Players Not Showing
- Verify players have "active" or "confirmed" status
- Check league selection is correct
- Ensure players are assigned to current season

### Warnings Not Accurate
- Match history is loaded on page load
- Refresh if you've created matches in another tab
- Check player IDs match correctly
