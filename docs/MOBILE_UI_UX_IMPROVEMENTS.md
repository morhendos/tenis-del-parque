// Add to your component
<MatchModals
  showResultModal={showResultModal}
  showScheduleModal={showScheduleModal}
  selectedMatch={selectedMatch}
  player={player}
  language={language}
  onCloseResult={() => setShowResultModal(false)}
  onCloseSchedule={() => setShowScheduleModal(false)}
  onSubmitResult={handleSubmitResult}
  onSubmitSchedule={handleSubmitSchedule}
