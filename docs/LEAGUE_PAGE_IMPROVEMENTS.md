# League Page Improvements - Summary

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Better CTA Button Labels** ✅
**Problem**: All leagues showed generic "View Details" button
**Solution**: Context-aware button labels based on league status:
- **Active leagues**: "Abrir Liga" / "Open League"
- **Upcoming leagues**: "Ver Información" / "View Info"  
- **Other leagues**: "Ver Liga" / "View League"

**File Modified**: `components/leagues/LeagueLevelCard.js`

---

### 2. **Upcoming Leagues Open Correct Pages** ✅
**Problem**: Clicking "View Details" on upcoming leagues opened the active league page instead of their own page.

**Root Cause**: The league page only supported fetching by location+season format (e.g., "summer2025"), but upcoming leagues have full slugs (e.g., "gold-league-sotogrande-autumn-2025").

**Solution**: Updated league page to:
1. **First try** fetching by slug using `/api/leagues/[slug]` endpoint
2. **Fallback** to old location+season method for backward compatibility
3. Both old and new URL formats now work perfectly

**File Modified**: `app/[locale]/[location]/liga/[season]/page.js`

**API Endpoints Used**:
- Primary: `/api/leagues/[slug]` - fetches league by slug ✅
- Fallback: `/api/leagues/location/[location]?season=[season]` - old method ✅

---

### 3. **Rich Information Page for Upcoming Leagues** ✅
**Problem**: Upcoming leagues showed empty standings with minimal information

**Solution**: Enhanced standings tab to show comprehensive league information when no standings exist:
- 🎾 **Visual appeal** with proper icons and styling
- 📅 **Start/End dates** prominently displayed
- 💰 **Price information** clearly shown
- 👥 **Available spots** highlighted
- 🎯 **Direct registration CTA** for registration_open leagues
- ✨ **Professional layout** with proper spacing and hierarchy

## 🔄 URL Structure

### Before:
```
/en/sotogrande/liga/gold-league-sotogrande-autumn-2025
                    └── Treated as season, caused API errors
```

### After:
```
/en/sotogrande/liga/gold-league-sotogrande-autumn-2025
                    └── Recognized as slug, fetches correct league ✅
```

Both formats supported:
- **New**: `/[locale]/[city]/liga/[full-league-slug]` → Fetches by slug
- **Old**: `/[locale]/[city]/liga/[season-format]` → Fetches by location+season
