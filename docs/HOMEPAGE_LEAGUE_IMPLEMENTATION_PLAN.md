## Current Status Summary

### âœ… Completed:
1. **Homepage redesign** with emotional focus
2. **Dynamic league display** from database
3. **Admin league management** (create, edit, status management)
4. **League page for active leagues** (standings, schedule, results)
5. **Fixed issues**:
   - `refreshLeagues` function error
   - Active leagues now link to league page instead of registration

### ðŸš§ In Progress / Next Steps:
1. **Coming Soon League Landing Pages**: Need separate pages for leagues with `coming_soon` status
2. **Waiting List System**: Complete database model, API, and UI
3. **Admin Waiting List Viewer**: To see who's interested in new leagues

## How to Test Current Implementation

1. **Create Estepona as coming soon**:
   - Go to `/admin/leagues`
   - Click "+ Create League"
   - Name: "Estepona", Slug: "estepona", Status: "Coming Soon"
   - City: "Estepona", Region: "MÃ¡laga"
   - Set expected launch date
   
2. **Check homepage**:
   - New league appears in "Coming Soon" section
   - Active leagues (Sotogrande) show "Ver Liga" button
   - Coming soon leagues show "Lista de Espera" button

3. **Test league page**:
   - Click "Ver Liga" on Sotogrande
   - Should go to `/es/sotogrande/liga/verano2025`
   - See standings, schedule, and results

## Notes

- Active leagues direct to league page (`/[locale]/[location]/liga/[season]`)
- Coming soon leagues need landing pages (`/[locale]/[location]`)
- Registration only available when season status is `registration_open`
- Keep all components modular and reusable âœ…
- Focus on authenticity over impressive numbers âœ…
