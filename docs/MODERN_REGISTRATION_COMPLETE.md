## 🎯 How It Works

### For Leagues with Specific Levels (Gold/Silver/Bronze)

**User sees:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ League Info Card                    │
│ - Gold League                       │
│ - Advanced Badge (auto-detected)    │
│ - Start Date: Nov 1, 2025          │
│ - Price: Free                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Already have an account? [Toggle]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Form shows:
✓ Name, Email, WhatsApp, Password
✗ NO level selection (already set!)
```

### For "All Levels" Leagues

**User sees:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ League Info Card                    │
│ - Liga de Sotogrande               │
│ - All Levels                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Form shows:
✓ Name, Email, WhatsApp
✓ Level selection (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
✓ Password
```

### Account Toggle Feature

**New User Mode:**
- Name input
- Email input  
- WhatsApp input
- Level selection (if needed)
- Password input
- Button: "Create Account & Register"

**Existing User Mode:**
- Email input only
- Password input only
- Forgot password link
- Button: "Sign In & Register"
- Toggle back: "Don't have an account? Create one"

## 🔄 User Flows

### Flow 1: New User Registration
```

2. Sees modern form with toggle OFF
3. Fills: Name, Email, WhatsApp, Password
4. (Level = "advanced" auto-set from league)
5. Clicks "Create Account & Register"
6. System creates user + registers to league
7. Shows success message with WhatsApp group link
```

### Flow 2: Existing User Registration
```
1. User clicks "Register" on Silver League
2. Sees modern form

4. Form switches to login mode
5. Enters: Email, Password
6. Clicks "Sign In & Register"
7. System authenticates, then registers to league
8. Shows success message
```

### Flow 3: Multi-League Registration
```

```

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Smart Level Detection
```javascript
const needsLevelSelection = league.skillLevel === 'all'
const leagueSkillName = skillLevelNames[locale][league.skillLevel]

// If league is Gold (advanced), form pre-fills:
formData.level = 'advanced'  // User doesn't see level selection
```

### Account Toggle State
```javascript
const [hasAccount, setHasAccount] = useState(false)

// When toggled ON:
- Show: Email + Password only
- Hide: Name, WhatsApp, Level selection

// When toggled OFF:
- Show: Full registration form
```

### Authentication Flow
```javascript
if (hasAccount) {
  // 1. Authenticate user
  const signInResult = await signIn('credentials', {...})
  
  // 2. If successful, register to league
  const response = await fetch('/api/players/register', {
    leagueId, level: league.skillLevel
  })
} else {
  // Create new user + register in one step
  const response = await fetch('/api/players/register', {
    name, email, whatsapp, password, level, leagueId
  })
}
```
