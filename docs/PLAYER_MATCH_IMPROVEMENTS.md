# Player Match Management Improvements

## Overview

This update improves and fixes the player match management functionality, ensuring consistency with the admin system and fixing bugs in the UI.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Player Result Submission API (`/api/player/matches/result/route.js`)

**Previous Issues:**
- Used simplified format (just set counts) instead of detailed set scores
- ELO calculation logic was duplicated and different from admin system
- Did not properly update player match history

**Improvements:**
- Now accepts detailed set scores in the same format as admin system
- Uses the same ELO calculation function as admin
- Properly updates player stats using the Player model's `updateMatchStats` method
- Supports walkover matches
- Validates match format (best of 3 sets)
- Updates sets won/lost statistics

**New API Format:**
```javascript
POST /api/player/matches/result
{
  matchId: "match_id",
  sets: [
    { myScore: 6, opponentScore: 4 },
    { myScore: 3, opponentScore: 6 },
    { myScore: 6, opponentScore: 2 }
  ],
  walkover: false,
  retiredPlayer: null
}
```

### 2. Updated Player Schedule API (`/api/player/matches/schedule/route.js`)

**Improvements:**
- Stores schedule data in the correct format matching the Match model schema
- Uses `club` field instead of `venue` in the database (while keeping `venue` in the API for backward compatibility)
- Properly validates future dates
- Stores notes in the match notes field

### 3. Fixed Player Matches UI (`/app/player/matches/page.js`)

**Previous Issues:**
- Accessed non-existent properties (e.g., `match.opponent`)
- Simple score input didn't support detailed set scores
- Result display was incorrect

**Improvements:**
- Proper opponent extraction using `getOpponent` helper function
- New result submission modal with:
  - Support for multiple sets (up to 3)
  - Add/remove set functionality
  - Walkover option
  - Set-by-set score input
- Improved completed matches display showing:
  - Correct set counts based on who won
  - Detailed set scores
  - Win/loss status
- Better error handling and loading states
- Form validation with user-friendly messages
- Disabled submit buttons while processing

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Player and admin systems now use the same format and logic
2. **Accuracy**: ELO calculations and stats updates are consistent across the platform
3. **User Experience**: Better UI with proper validation and feedback
4. **Data Integrity**: Results are stored in the same format regardless of who enters them

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Match Scheduling:**
   - Schedule a match from player dashboard
   - Verify the schedule appears correctly
   - Check that past dates are not allowed

2. **Test Result Submission:**
   - Submit a normal match result with 2-3 sets
   - Submit a walkover
   - Verify ELO changes are reflected
   - Check that standings are updated correctly

3. **Test UI:**
   - Check that opponent names display correctly
   - Verify set scores display properly in completed matches
   - Test add/remove set functionality
   - Ensure modals close properly after submission

## Migration Notes

No database migration is required as we're using the existing schema. The changes are backward compatible with existing data.
