# Player Match Management Improvements

## Overview

This update improves and fixes the player match management functionality, ensuring consistency with the admin system and fixing bugs in the UI.

## Major Architectural Improvement: Single Source of Truth

### Previous Architecture
- Points were stored in `player.stats.totalPoints` field
- Points were calculated and updated when match results were submitted
- Risk of data drift between stored points and actual match results
- If scoring rules changed, historical data wouldn't reflect new rules

### New Architecture
- **Points are calculated dynamically from match results**
- Match results are the single source of truth
- Standings API calculates points on-the-fly using the `Match.calculatePoints()` method
- No risk of data inconsistency
- Scoring rules can be changed and will automatically apply to all historical data

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Match Model (`/lib/models/Match.js`)

Added methods for calculating points:
- `calculatePoints()` - Returns points for both players based on match result
- `getPointsForPlayer(playerId)` - Returns points for a specific player
- `calculatePlayerPoints()` - Static method to calculate total points for a player

Points calculation logic:
- Win 2-0: 3 points
- Win 2-1: 2 points
- Lose 1-2: 1 point
- Lose 0-2: 0 points

### 2. Updated Standings API (`/app/api/leagues/[league]/standings/route.js`)

**Major Changes**: 
- Now calculates points from matches instead of reading from database
- Fetches all completed matches for the league/season
- Uses `match.calculatePoints()` to get points for each match
- Aggregates points for each player
- No longer relies on `player.stats.totalPoints`
- **NEW: Sorts by player status first**
  - Active players appear at the top
  - Inactive/pending players appear below
  - Within each status group, players are sorted by points

Sorting priority:
1. Player status (active → confirmed → pending → inactive)
2. Total points (calculated from matches)
3. Sets won
4. Games won
5. Alphabetical by name

### 3. Fixed Player Result Submission API (`/api/player/matches/result/route.js`)

**Previous Issues:**
- Used simplified format (just set counts) instead of detailed set scores
- ELO calculation logic was duplicated and different from admin system
- Did not properly update player match history

**Improvements:**
- Now accepts detailed set scores in the same format as admin system
- Uses the same ELO calculation function as admin
- Properly updates player stats using the Player model's `updateMatchStats` method
- Supports walkover matches
- Validates match format (best of 3 sets)
- Updates sets won/lost statistics
- **No longer updates totalPoints (calculated from matches)**

**API Format:**
```javascript
POST /api/player/matches/result
{
  matchId: "match_id",
  sets: [
    { myScore: 6, opponentScore: 4 },
    { myScore: 3, opponentScore: 6 },
    { myScore: 6, opponentScore: 2 }
  ],
  walkover: false,
  retiredPlayer: null
}
```

### 4. Updated Admin Match API (`/api/admin/matches/[id]/route.js`)

- **No longer updates totalPoints**
- Points are calculated from match results when standings are requested

### 5. Updated Player Schedule API (`/api/player/matches/schedule/route.js`)

**Improvements:**
- Stores schedule data in the correct format matching the Match model schema
- Uses `club` field instead of `venue` in the database (while keeping `venue` in the API for backward compatibility)
- Properly validates future dates
- Stores notes in the match notes field

### 6. Fixed Player Matches UI (`/app/player/matches/page.js`)

**Previous Issues:**
- Accessed non-existent properties (e.g., `match.opponent`)
- Simple score input didn't support detailed set scores
- Result display was incorrect

**Improvements:**
- Proper opponent extraction using `getOpponent` helper function
- New result submission modal with:
  - Support for multiple sets (up to 3)
  - Add/remove set functionality
  - Walkover option
  - Set-by-set score input
- Improved completed matches display showing:
  - Correct set counts based on who won
  - Detailed set scores
  - Win/loss status
- Better error handling and loading states
- Form validation with user-friendly messages
- Disabled submit buttons while processing

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Points are always consistent with match results
2. **Flexibility**: Scoring rules can be changed without data migration
3. **Consistency**: Player and admin systems use the same format and logic
4. **Accuracy**: ELO calculations and stats updates are consistent across the platform
5. **User Experience**: Better UI with proper validation and feedback
6. **Single Source of Truth**: Match results are the authoritative data source
7. **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Active players shown prominently at top of standings

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Match Scheduling:**
   - Schedule a match from player dashboard
   - Verify the schedule appears correctly
   - Check that past dates are not allowed

2. **Test Result Submission:**
   - Submit a normal match result with 2-3 sets
   - Submit a walkover
   - Verify ELO changes are reflected
   - **Check that standings show correct points (calculated from matches)**

3. **Test UI:**
   - Check that opponent names display correctly
   - Verify set scores display properly in completed matches
   - Test add/remove set functionality
   - Ensure modals close properly after submission

4. **Test Points Calculation:**
   - Win 2-0 should show 3 points in standings
   - Win 2-1 should show 2 points in standings
   - Loss 1-2 should show 1 point in standings
   - Loss 0-2 should show 0 points in standings
   - Points should be calculated dynamically each time standings are loaded

5. **Test Standings Display:**
   - Active players should appear at the top
   - Inactive/pending players should appear below
   - Within each group, players should be sorted by points

## Migration Notes

No database migration is required. The `totalPoints` field in the Player model can remain but is no longer used or updated. Points are now calculated on-demand from match results.
