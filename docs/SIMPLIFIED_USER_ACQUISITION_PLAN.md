---

## ⚠️ ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE - DUPLICATE REGISTRATION ROUTES

**THE PROBLEM**: We have TWO separate registration routes:
- `/signup/[league]` - Old route (no locale support)
- `/[locale]/registro/[league]` - New route (Spanish only in name)

This is bad for maintenance, SEO, and user experience.

**RECOMMENDED FIX**: Use ONE internationalized route:
- `/[locale]/register/[league]` - Unified route for all languages
- Delete the old `/signup/[league]` route
- Set up redirects from old URLs

## Overview

This document outlines a **simple but effective** user acquisition process for tennis league signups. The focus is on clear communication, realistic expectations, and building excitement without over-promising features we don't have yet.

## Core Principles

- ✅ **Simple and clear communication**
- ✅ **Set proper expectations** 
- ✅ **Build excitement for league launch**
- ✅ **Easy to implement and maintain**
- ❌ No SMS campaigns
- ❌ No gamification or point systems
- ❌ No special perks or early access features
- ❌ No complex automation

## Important Strategy Update (Sept 2024)

**NO PLAYER COUNTS SHOWN**: We've removed all player count displays and progress bars from the success page and emails to avoid discouraging players when numbers are low. Focus is now on community and excitement rather than metrics.
