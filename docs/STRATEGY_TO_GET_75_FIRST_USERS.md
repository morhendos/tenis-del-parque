# Step-by-Step Strategy to Get First 75 Paying Users

## Step 1: Choose the Right Cities

Don’t spread too thin. Start with 1–2 mid-size cities where:
- Tennis is popular but not over-saturated
- There are active amateur players on Instagram/Facebook
- Examples: **Valencia**, **Seville**, **Zaragoza**
- Avoid starting in Madrid/Barcelona unless you have a big budget

➡️ **Start with 1 city**, maybe test ads in 2–3 to see where traction is best, then focus.

## Step 3: Estimate Conversion Funnel

| Funnel Stage              | % Conversion | Example Numbers     |
|---------------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Ad clicks → landing page  | ~3–5%        | 2,000 people        |
| Landing page → signups    | ~15–25%      | ~400 emails         |
| Signups → paying players  | ~15–20%      | ~75 players         |

To get **75 paying users**, you likely need:
- ~2,000 ad clicks  
- ~400+ signups to a waitlist

## Budget Estimate for Ads

Assuming **€0.40–€0.60 per click** (realistic in Spain for niche local campaigns):

| Metric          | Estimate     |
|------------------|--------------|
| Clicks needed     | ~2,000       |
| Cost per click    | €0.50 avg    |
| **Total budget**  | **~€1,000**  |

### Tips to Lower Budget:
- Improve landing page conversion rate
- Use video or testimonial-style ads
- Run ads in evenings/weekends (when players browse)
- Add a “Win free gear” raffle to boost signups
