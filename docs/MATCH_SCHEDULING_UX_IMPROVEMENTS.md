# Match Scheduling UX Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the UX improvements made to the match scheduling functionality in the tennis league platform.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Edit Functionality for Scheduled Matches
- Players can now edit/reschedule already scheduled matches
- The edit functionality is available from both:
  - Player matches page (`/player/matches`)
  - League schedule tab (`/player/league` - Schedule tab)

### 2. Prefilled Schedule Form
When editing a scheduled match, the form is automatically prefilled with:
- **Date**: Previously selected date
- **Time**: Previously selected time
- **Venue**: Previously entered venue/club name
- **Court**: Previously entered court number
- **Notes**: Any previously added notes

### 3. Prominent Reschedule Button
- Replaced the small pencil icon with a full-sized button
- Button shows different text and color based on match status:
  - **"Schedule"** (blue) - for unscheduled matches
  - **"Reschedule"** (orange) - for already scheduled matches
- Button has the same size and prominence as other action buttons

### 4. Complete Information Display
All scheduled match information is now visible on the match card:
- Date and time with proper formatting
- Venue/Club location
- Court number
- Notes (if any were added)
- All information is displayed with appropriate icons for easy scanning
