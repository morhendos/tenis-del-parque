# Pull Request: Multilingual SEO Foundation & Multi-League Support

- **Complete translations**: All existing pages now support both Spanish and English

### 2. Multi-League Homepage

- **Coming soon cities**: Barcelona, Madrid, Marbella marked as upcoming
- **Dynamic content**: Hero, features, testimonials, and FAQ sections
- **Mobile optimized**: Fully responsive design for all screen sizes

### 3. City-Based Signup Flow
- **Dynamic routes**: `/es/registro/[ciudad]` and `/en/signup/[city]`

- **Error handling**: Comprehensive validation and user feedback
