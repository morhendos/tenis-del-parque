# Improved Round Match Creation

## Overview

This feature improves the match creation process by allowing administrators to add matches to existing rounds at any time, addressing the issue where once you navigate away from a round, you cannot add more matches to it.

## Features Added

### 1. **Add Matches to Existing Rounds**
- In the matches listing page, each round now has an "Add Matches to Round X" button
- Clicking this button takes you to the match creation page with that round pre-selected
- You can add matches to any existing round at any time

### 2. **Round Selection in Match Creation**
- New radio button selector: "Create New Round" vs "Add to Existing Round"
- When "Add to Existing Round" is selected, a dropdown shows all existing rounds
- The system remembers your round selection using session storage
- When navigating from a specific round, it automatically selects that round

### 3. **Improved Match Listing Display**
- Matches are now grouped by round when viewing all rounds
- Each round shows the total number of matches
- Easy access to add more matches to any round

### 4. **Session Storage for Round Selection**
- The match creation page remembers your last round selection
- When you navigate away and come back, your round choice is preserved
- This makes it easy to work on multiple rounds without losing context
