# Amateur Tennis Players in Costa del Sol: Analysis and Estimates

## Overview

The Costa del Sol, within Málaga province in southern Spain, offers an exceptional climate and sports infrastructure fueling active tennis participation. Tennis is popular across its coastal cities, with numerous clubs and academies attracting both local and visiting amateurs throughout the year.

## Estimated Amateur Tennis Players by City

The table below provides rough estimates of amateur tennis player numbers currently active in clubs, leagues, and local circuits in six notable Costa del Sol cities:

| City                       | Estimated Amateur Players |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Sotogrande                 | 200                      |
| Estepona                   | 300                      |
| Marbella                   | 2,000                    |
| Malaga                     | 800                      |
| La Línea de la Concepción  | 250–350                  |
| Algeciras                  | 220–300                  |

### Notes
- **Sotogrande:** A dedicated but modestly sized tennis community centered around clubs like EL Octógono and SotoTennis Academy.
- **Estepona:** Steadily growing amateur scene, supported by multiple clubs and partner-platform listings.
- **Marbella:** The regional tennis hub with many top clubs (including Manolo Santana Racquets Club and Rafa Nadal Academy) and a large base of both resident and visiting amateurs.
- **Malaga:** Diverse tennis ecosystem with many public/private courts and sustained local play.
- **La Línea de la Concepción:** Several clubs and academies serve all ages, yielding an estimated amateur base comparable to similar regional towns.
- **Algeciras:** Active local club established since 1919 (Algeciras Club de Tenis), with regular coaching, tournaments, and social play suggesting an amateur count in the range of 220–300 players, based on local club size and participation trends.

These numbers reflect mostly club, league, and regularly active recreational players; less frequent participants may modestly increase these estimates.

## Potential Social Media Ads Reach

Based on typical social media engagement among amateur sports participants in Spain, it is estimated that around 60% of these amateur tennis players are active and can be reasonably targeted via social media ad campaigns.

| City                       | Estimated Players | Estimated Reachable via Socials (60%) |
|----------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Sotogrande                 | 200              | 120                                   |
| Estepona                   | 300              | 180                                   |
| Marbella                   | 2,000            | 1,200                                 |
| Malaga                     | 800              | 480                                   |
| La Línea de la Concepción  | 250–350          | 150–210                               |
| Algeciras                  | 220–300          | 132–180                               |
| **TOTAL**                  | **3,770–3,950**  | **2,262–2,370**                       |

Your social media ads campaign can therefore potentially reach approximately 2,200–2,400 amateur tennis players across the Costa del Sol cities listed.

### Important Notes
