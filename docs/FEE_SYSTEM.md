# Tennis League App Expansion Plan

## 🎯 Strategy Overview
- **Early Registration Offer**:  
  Provide free or discounted registration for the first season to users who sign up early. This encourages fast onboarding and builds momentum.

## 🤝 Affiliate Program
- **Referral Benefit**:  
  Registered players can refer friends. For each successful referral, the player earns:
  - A discount on the next season, or
  - A free subscription period.

- **Conditions**:  
  Referred users must complete registration and play at least one match for the referral to count.

## 🔗 Combined Approach
- **Dual Incentive**:  
  Early registrants are automatically eligible for the affiliate program, giving them two benefits:
  - Free or discounted access now.
  - The ability to earn further discounts by bringing in more players.

- **Messaging**:  
  Make the dual offer clear on your registration and marketing pages to maximize sign-ups and referrals.
