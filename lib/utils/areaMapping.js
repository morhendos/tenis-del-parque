/**
 * ⚠️ LEGACY FILE - COMPLETELY REMOVED ⚠️
 * 
 * This file contained manual area-to-city mapping which has been 
 * fully replaced with GPS-based polygon area detection.
 * 
 * All club assignments are now handled automatically through 
 * geographic coordinates using the Areas Map Editor.
 * 
 * For GPS-based area functionality, see:
 * - /lib/utils/geographicBoundaries.js - League polygon definitions
 * - /components/admin/areas/ - Area management components
 * - /app/api/clubs/route.js - Updated API with GPS-based assignments
 * 
 * This file has been removed to prevent conflicts between legacy 
 * hardcoded mappings and the new GPS-based assignment system.
