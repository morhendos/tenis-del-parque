# Proper Multi-League Player Model

This branch implements the **correct long-term solution** for multi-league player registration by restructuring the Player model to support multiple league registrations per person.

## üéØ The Problem (Before)

```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC: Multiple Player documents for same person
Player 1: { email: "john@example.com", league: "estepona", level: "intermediate" }
Player 2: { email: "john@example.com", league: "sotogrande", level: "intermediate" }
Player 3: { email: "john@example.com", league: "estepona", season: "winter-2025" }
```

**Issues:**
- ‚ùå Data duplication (name, email, whatsapp stored multiple times)
- ‚ùå Data inconsistency risk (update info in one league but not others)  
- ‚ùå Complex cross-league queries
- ‚ùå Poor user experience (multiple "profiles")

## ‚úÖ The Solution (After)

```javascript
// PROPER: One Player document with registrations array
Player: {
  email: "john@example.com",
  name: "John Doe", 
  whatsapp: "+34600000000",
  registrations: [
    { league: "estepona", season: "summer-2025", level: "intermediate", stats: {...} },
    { league: "sotogrande", season: "summer-2025", level: "intermediate", stats: {...} },
    { league: "estepona", season: "winter-2025", level: "advanced", stats: {...} }
  ],
  preferences: { preferredLanguage: "es" },
  metadata: { firstRegistrationDate: "2025-06-01" }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **One person = one email = one Player document**
- ‚úÖ **No data duplication** - personal info stored once
- ‚úÖ **League-specific data** - stats, match history per registration
- ‚úÖ **Better user experience** - single profile across all leagues
- ‚úÖ **Easier queries** - find all leagues for a person
- ‚úÖ **Future-proof** - ready for user accounts, global rankings, etc.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Changes

### Player Model Structure
```javascript
Player: {
  // GLOBAL (per person)
  email: "unique@example.com",     // Unique globally
  name: "John Doe",                // Personal info stored once
  whatsapp: "+34600000000",
  userId: ObjectId,                // Link to user account
  
  // REGISTRATIONS (per league/season)
  registrations: [{
    league: ObjectId,              // League reference
    season: "summer-2025",         // Season identifier
    level: "intermediate",         // Level for this league
    status: "active",              // Status in this league
    registeredAt: Date,
    
    // League-specific data
    stats: { matches: 10, wins: 7, elo: 1250, ... },
    matchHistory: [...],
    wildCards: { total: 3, used: 1, ... },
    notes: "Admin notes for this league"
  }],
  
  // GLOBAL PREFERENCES
  preferences: {
    emailNotifications: true,
    preferredLanguage: "es"
  },
  
  // METADATA
  metadata: {
    firstRegistrationDate: Date,
    source: "web"
  }
}
```

### New Player Methods
```javascript
// Add registration for new league/season
player.addLeagueRegistration(leagueId, season, level, status)

// Get specific registration
player.getLeagueRegistration(leagueId, season)

// Check participation eligibility
player.canParticipateInLeague(leagueId, season)

// Update stats for specific league
player.updateMatchStatsForLeague(leagueId, season, matchResult)
```

### Updated API Endpoints
- **Registration**: Finds existing player or creates new one, adds league registration
- **Player queries**: Use aggregation to find players by league
- **Standings**: Calculate per league using aggregation pipeline

## üîÑ Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Migration
```bash
# 1. Migrate existing data to new structure
node scripts/migrateToNewPlayerModel.js

# 2. Verify migration results
# 3. Test with migrated data
```

### Phase 2: Code Updates
Update all code that depends on Player model:
- ‚úÖ Player model (`lib/models/Player.js`)
- ‚úÖ Registration API (`app/api/players/register/route.js`)  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Admin player management
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Match generation logic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Player dashboard queries
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Standings calculations

### Phase 3: Go Live
```bash
# Perform database cutover
node scripts/migrateToNewPlayerModel.js cutover
```

### Phase 4: Cleanup
```bash
# Remove old backup collections when confident
# Update any remaining legacy code
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Before Migration
- [ ] Run migration on staging environment
- [ ] Verify data integrity and counts
- [ ] Test new Player model methods

### After Migration
- [ ] Test player registration (new users)
- [ ] Test multi-league registration (existing users)
- [ ] Test admin player management
- [ ] Test match generation
- [ ] Test player dashboard
- [ ] Test standings calculations
- [ ] Verify no data loss

### Registration Scenarios
- [ ] **New user, first league** ‚Üí Create new Player with first registration
- [ ] **Existing user, new league** ‚Üí Add registration to existing Player
- [ ] **Existing user, same league/season** ‚Üí Block with appropriate message
- [ ] **Existing user, new season** ‚Üí Add registration for new season

## üö® Breaking Changes

This is a **breaking change** that affects:

### Database Schema
- Player documents completely restructured
- Old queries using `league` field directly will break
- Need aggregation for league-specific queries

### API Responses  
- Player data structure changed
- Stats now nested under `registrations[].stats`
- Need to update frontend code consuming player data

### Admin Interfaces
- Player management screens need updates
- League filtering logic needs updates
- Player editing forms need restructuring

## üîß Code Migration Examples

### Finding Players by League (Before)
```javascript
// OLD - Simple query
const players = await Player.find({ league: leagueId })
```

### Finding Players by League (After)  
```javascript
// NEW - Using static method
const players = await Player.findByLeague(leagueId, season)

// OR using aggregation
const players = await Player.find({
  registrations: {
    $elemMatch: { league: leagueId, season: season }
  }
})
```

### Getting Player Stats (Before)
```javascript
// OLD - Direct access
const elo = player.stats.eloRating
```

### Getting Player Stats (After)
```javascript
// NEW - Get specific registration
const registration = player.getLeagueRegistration(leagueId, season)
const elo = registration.stats.eloRating
```

## üì¶ Deployment Plan

### Staging Deployment
1. Deploy new Player model to staging
2. Run migration script on staging data
3. Update dependent code
4. Test all functionality thoroughly
5. Performance test with realistic data

### Production Deployment
1. **Maintenance window** - Announce downtime
2. Create final backup
3. Run migration (estimated time: ~5-10 minutes for 1000 players)
4. Deploy updated code
5. Verify functionality
6. Monitor for issues

### Rollback Plan
```bash
# If issues arise, rollback database
node scripts/migrateToNewPlayerModel.js rollback

# Deploy previous code version
# Investigate and fix issues
# Re-attempt migration when ready
```

## üéØ Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ **No data loss** - All existing players and registrations preserved
- ‚úÖ **No broken functionality** - All features continue to work
- ‚úÖ **Improved performance** - Fewer database documents, better queries
- ‚úÖ **Multi-league registration works** - Existing users can join new leagues
- ‚úÖ **Admin tools updated** - Player management works with new model

## üöÄ Future Enhancements Enabled

This proper data model enables:
